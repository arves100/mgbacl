# Mobile Adapter GB Comunication Library

A library that allows C/C++ GBC games to comuniucate with the Mobile Adapter GB.

Nintendo has recycle the whole comunication from the GameBoy Printer, the same protocol
used in the printer works fine with the adapter.

Tested with BGB (Mobile Adapter Script) and GBDK 3-2.95-3
